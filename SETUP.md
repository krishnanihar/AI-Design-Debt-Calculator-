- **21-40**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium debt - needs work before AI launch
- **41-60**: ‚ö†Ô∏è High debt - major refactoring required
- **61-100**: üö´ Critical debt - not safe for AI integration

**Severity Badges**
- **Critical** (red): Will break in production - fix immediately
- **High** (orange): Major issues - fix before AI launch
- **Medium** (yellow): Degraded experience - plan remediation
- **Low** (green): Minor issues - fix opportunistically

**Remediation Effort**
- Measured in story points
- Based on industry averages
- Includes all identified issues
- Use for sprint planning

## Troubleshooting

### "Demo Mode" is showing but I set up Supabase

**Problem**: Environment variables not loaded

**Solution**:
1. Make sure `.env` file is in the root directory
2. Check that variable names match exactly: `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
3. Restart the dev server (`Ctrl+C` then `npm run dev`)
4. Hard refresh your browser (`Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R`)

### Google login button does nothing

**Problem**: OAuth not configured correctly

**Solution**:
1. Check your redirect URI in Google Cloud Console matches Supabase exactly
2. Make sure Google Provider is enabled in Supabase (Authentication ‚Üí Providers)
3. Check browser console for errors (F12)
4. Try the Supabase dashboard login test: Authentication ‚Üí Providers ‚Üí Google ‚Üí "Test"

### "Failed to create project" error

**Problem**: Row Level Security or database permissions

**Solution**:
1. Make sure you ran the ENTIRE `supabase-schema.sql` script
2. Check Supabase logs: Logs ‚Üí Postgres Logs
3. Verify your user was created: Table Editor ‚Üí users (should have your email)
4. Try signing out and back in

### Components not saving

**Problem**: RLS policies or network issues

**Solution**:
1. Open browser DevTools (F12) ‚Üí Network tab
2. Try adding a component
3. Look for failed requests (red)
4. Check the response for error messages
5. Verify you have a project selected (dropdown shows project name, not "Select Project")

### Build errors

**Problem**: TypeScript or dependency issues

**Solution**:
```bash
# Clear cache and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# Try building
npm run build
```

## Deployment

### Deploying to Vercel (Recommended)

1. **Push code to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git remote add origin your-repo-url
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Import to Vercel**
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Click "Import Project"
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Vercel auto-detects Vite configuration

3. **Add environment variables**
   - In Vercel project settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
   - Add `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
   - Add `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - Apply to Production, Preview, and Development

4. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Wait for build to complete
   - You'll get a URL like `your-app.vercel.app`

5. **Update OAuth settings**
   - Add Vercel URL to Google Cloud Console authorized origins
   - Add `https://your-app.vercel.app` to authorized JavaScript origins
   - Add Supabase callback URL for this domain
   - Update Supabase Auth ‚Üí Site URL to your Vercel URL

### Deploying to Other Platforms

The app is a static site (after build) and can be deployed anywhere:

**Netlify**
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Publish directory: `dist`
- Add environment variables in Netlify UI

**Cloudflare Pages**
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Build output: `dist`
- Add environment variables in Pages settings

**AWS S3 + CloudFront**
- Build locally: `npm run build`
- Upload `dist/` folder to S3
- Configure CloudFront distribution
- Set environment variables during build

## Database Backup

**Export your data** (recommended before major changes):

```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
COPY (SELECT * FROM projects) TO STDOUT WITH CSV HEADER;
COPY (SELECT * FROM components) TO STDOUT WITH CSV HEADER;
```

## Security Notes

- The `anon` key is safe to expose in your frontend code
- Row Level Security (RLS) ensures users can only access their own data
- Never commit your `.env` file to Git
- Rotate keys if accidentally exposed (Supabase Settings ‚Üí API)

## Support

For issues:
1. Check this guide thoroughly
2. Review `supabase-schema.sql` for database structure
3. Check browser console for errors (F12)
4. Contact the development team with:
   - What you were trying to do
   - What happened instead
   - Browser console errors
   - Supabase logs (if applicable)

## Next Steps

Once you have the app running:

1. **Add your real components**: Start with your most-used components
2. **Run analysis**: Check the Heatmap and Report tabs
3. **Prioritize fixes**: Focus on Critical and High severity first
4. **Track progress**: Re-analyze after making changes
5. **Share with team**: Use the Report tab to generate executive summaries
